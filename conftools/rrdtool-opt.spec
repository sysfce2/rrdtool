# RPM spec for the upstream `/opt/rrdtool` build of RRDtool.
#
# This is intentionally NOT a drop-in replacement for the FHS-compliant
# distribution package. It installs everything (binaries, library, headers,
# Perl/Python/Tcl/Lua/Ruby bindings) under /opt/rrdtool and coexists
# with the distro's `rrdtool` package without touching the system.
#
# @VERSION@ is substituted by the release workflow before invoking rpmbuild.

%description
RRDtool is the OpenSource industry standard high performance data
logging and graphing system for time series data.

This package installs RRDtool entirely under /opt/rrdtool so it does not
conflict with the distribution-provided rrdtool package. To make it
discoverable from your shell:

    . /opt/rrdtool/bin/rrdtool-env.sh

That puts /opt/rrdtool/bin on PATH and makes the bundled language
bindings (Perl, Python, Tcl, Lua, Ruby) findable by their interpreters.

For C/C++ consumers, set PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/rrdtool/lib/pkgconfig and
compile with `pkg-config --cflags --libs librrd`; the resulting binary
gets /opt/rrdtool/lib baked in via -Wl,-rpath, so no system linker
config (ld.so.conf) is required.

Language bindings are present on disk but their interpreters (perl,
python3, tcl, lua, ruby) are NOT pulled in as hard dependencies of this
package — install them yourself if you want to use them.
